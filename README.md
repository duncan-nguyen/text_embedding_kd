# ICLR Embedding KD

This repository distills compact text embedding students from large embedding
teachers. The reproduction target follows the Qwen3 to BERT-base pair in
`docs/TALAS.pdf`:

```text
Qwen3-Embedding-4B -> BERT-base 109M
```

The training corpus follows the TALAS paper setup: about 15K unlabeled sentences
sampled from the three in-domain datasets EMOTION, WiC, and STS-B. In this repo,
that corpus is:

```text
data/train_set/merged_3_data_5k_each.csv
```

Benchmark CSV files are separated under `data/train_set/`, `data/val_set/`,
and `data/test_set/`. Classification probe train and validation files are
checked for normalized-text leakage before evaluation.

## Environment

Do not install packages into the global Python environment. Create and use a
project virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Weights & Biases logging:

```bash
wandb login
```

If you want a local/offline W&B run:

```bash
export WANDB_MODE=offline
```

## Methods

`--method` selects the distillation objective. Each one has its own config class
under `config/`, which supplies the defaults that the CLI flags then override:

| `--method` | Config | Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `talas` | `config/talas_config.py` | Teacher-anchor KD on cached teacher embeddings, with a structural term and SAM |
| `cdm` | `config/cdm_config.py` | Contextual dynamic mapping across the two tokenizers |
| `dskd` | `config/dskd_config.py` | Dual-space KD with a learned projection |
| `emo` | `config/emo_config.py` | Optimal-transport embedding distillation |
| `rkd` | `config/rkd_config.py` | Relational KD (Park et al., 2019): distance-wise + angle-wise relations |
| `pkt` | `config/pkt_config.py` | Probabilistic KT (Passalis & Tefas, 2018): conditional affinity distributions |
| `stella` | `config/stella_config.py` | Stella multi-dimension student heads |

`talas` caches the teacher's sentence embeddings once (`cache_path`) and frees
the teacher model afterwards; the other methods run the teacher alongside the
student every step.

`rkd` reproduces Park et al., *Relational Knowledge Distillation* (CVPR 2019),
unchanged: it matches the pairwise-distance and triplet-angle structure of the
teacher's embeddings rather than the embeddings themselves, so it learns no
projection head and the two embedding dimensionalities need not match. Its
weights follow the paper's metric-learning setting, `--dist_ratio 1
--angle_ratio 2` (RKD-DA); setting either ratio to `0` gives the paper's
single-potential RKD-D or RKD-A variants.

`pkt` reproduces Passalis & Tefas, *Learning Deep Representations with
Probabilistic Knowledge Transfer* (ECCV 2018; extended in IEEE TNNLS 32(5), the
version cited here). It matches the conditional affinity distribution each
sentence induces over the rest of the batch, under the paper's cosine kernel,
and like `rkd` it learns no projection. Two places where the paper and the
authors' released code disagree are exposed as config settings rather than
silently resolved: `exclude_self` (the paper's Eq. 3/4/8 drop the self term, the
released code keeps it) and `reduction` (`sum` is Eq. 8 verbatim, `mean` is the
released code, `batchmean` is the default per-anchor KL). The paper transfers
with no supervised term, so `w_task` defaults to `0.0`.

Training is single-process. Two visible CUDA devices place the student on
`cuda:0` and the teacher on `cuda:1`; one device puts both on `cuda:0`.

## Run

From the repo root:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
bash scripts/train_talas.sh
```

One script per method lives in `scripts/` (`train_talas.sh`, `train_cdm.sh`,
`train_dskd.sh`, `train_emo.sh`, `train_pkt.sh`, `train_rkd.sh`, `train_stella.sh`,
plus `.ps1` equivalents).

Or run the Python entry point directly:

```bash
python3 main.py \
  --method talas \
  --train_data data/train_set/merged_3_data_5k_each.csv \
  --student_model google-bert/bert-base-uncased \
  --teacher_model Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B \
  --batch_size 32 \
  --epochs 5 \
  --lr 2e-5 \
  --max_length 256 \
  --save_dir models/talas/qwen3_4b_to_bert_base
```

To disable W&B:

```bash
python3 main.py --method talas --no_wandb
```

To persist student weights after every epoch, provide a durable directory:

```bash
python3 main.py --method talas \
  --weights_dir "/content/drive/MyDrive/[ICLR] Embedding KD/weights/qwen3_4b_to_bert_base"
```

`test_mdd.ipynb` is the Colab runner: it trains several teacher/student pairs
sequentially and writes per-pair logs, tables and figures to Google Drive.

## Outputs

Model checkpoints and weights are saved under `--save_dir`, e.g.:

```text
models/talas/qwen3_4b_to_bert_base/
```

Training and benchmark metrics are written to:

```text
models/talas/qwen3_4b_to_bert_base/metrics.jsonl     # one record per epoch
models/talas/qwen3_4b_to_bert_base/step_metrics.jsonl # one record per optimizer step
```

Validation is evaluated and printed after every epoch. Test is evaluated and
printed once after training. The Colab notebook exports the two splits
separately:

```text
models/talas/qwen3_4b_to_bert_base/validation_by_epoch.csv
models/talas/qwen3_4b_to_bert_base/final_test_results.csv
```

The teacher embedding cache is written to `--cache_path`, e.g.:

```text
cache/talas/qwen3_4b_bert_base_teacher_train.pt
```

## Rebuilding Caches

The cache is keyed only by its path, so a change of training corpus, teacher
model or pooling needs the old file removed first:

```bash
rm cache/talas/qwen3_4b_bert_base_teacher_train.pt
```

Then rerun training. A cache whose row count does not match the corpus is
rejected at startup rather than silently misaligned.

## Benchmarks

The training loop evaluates these benchmark groups:

Classification:

```text
Banking77, Emotion, Tweet
```

Pair classification:

```text
MRPC, SciTail, WiC
```

Semantic textual similarity:

```text
SICK, STS12, STS-B
```

Validation runs after each epoch. Final test evaluation runs after training,
reusing pair-classification thresholds selected on validation.

Only the three classification benchmarks read a train split: their score comes
from a logistic-regression probe fitted on train embeddings. The pair and STS
benchmarks are scored without fitting anything, so their train splits are on
disk for completeness only. To (re)fetch them:

```bash
python3 scripts/download_eval_train_splits.py            # skips what exists
python3 scripts/download_eval_train_splits.py --force    # refetch everything
```

The script rebuilds each benchmark's existing validation and test files from the
upstream source first and refuses to write the train split unless they match, so
a source that has drifted fails loudly instead of landing a mismatched split.

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
```
